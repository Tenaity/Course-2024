| **Feature**                      | **High-Level Languages**                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Low-Level Languages**                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Abstraction from Hardware**     | High-level languages are abstracted from the hardware, meaning the developer does not need to manage memory or hardware resources directly.                                                                              | Low-level languages are closer to the hardware, offering little to no abstraction. Developers have direct control over memory and CPU usage.                                                                |
| **Example:**                      | In Python, you can simply create a variable without worrying about memory allocation. <br>```python<br>x = 10```                                                                                                         | In Assembly, you need to manage memory manually, and you might need to use registers for storing values. <br>Example in Assembly: <br>```MOV AX, 10```                                                      |
| **Ease of Learning and Use**      | High-level languages are designed to be user-friendly, with simpler syntax and extensive libraries, making them easier to learn and use.                                                                                 | Low-level languages have a more complex syntax, requiring a deeper understanding of computer architecture, making them harder to learn.                                                                      |
| **Example:**                      | Writing a simple loop in Java is straightforward: <br>```java<br>for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i); }```                                                                                             | In Assembly, a loop requires more detailed instructions: <br>```assembly<br>mov cx, 10<br>loop_start:<br>... ; some operations<br>loop loop_start```                                                       |
| **Portability**                   | High-level languages are generally platform-independent, meaning the same code can run on different types of systems without modification.                                                                               | Low-level languages are often platform-dependent, meaning the code is tailored to specific hardware and may not run on other systems without significant changes.                                           |
| **Example:**                      | A Python program can run on any operating system that has Python installed, without needing any changes to the code.                                                                                                    | Assembly code written for an x86 processor won’t work on an ARM processor without rewriting it for that architecture.                                                                                       |
| **Performance**                   | High-level languages are generally slower because they involve more abstraction, and the code must be translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter.                                                        | Low-level languages offer better performance because the code is closer to machine code and can be optimized for specific hardware.                                                                         |
| **Example:**                      | A Python program might take longer to execute compared to an equivalent C program due to the overhead of interpretation and higher-level abstractions.                                                                  | A C program, especially one optimized with manual memory management, can run faster and more efficiently than a high-level Python program.                                                                  |
| **Control over Hardware**         | High-level languages offer limited control over hardware resources like memory and CPU, as they handle these details automatically.                                                                                    | Low-level languages provide granular control over hardware, allowing developers to optimize performance and resource usage.                                                                                 |
| **Example:**                      | In Java, memory management is handled by the garbage collector, so you don’t have to worry about freeing up memory.                                                                                                     | In C, you manage memory manually using `malloc()` and `free()`, which allows for more control but also requires careful management to avoid memory leaks.                                                   |
